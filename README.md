## Reflections
### Shooting
A woman fired a shot at a man with her gun, but the man did not die. List the possible
reasons for the man not dying.
```
She missed
She hit a non vital organ
There was an ambulance nearby
It was a blank
```

### Alien
An alien meets you and it asks you to teach it how to brush its teeth. Assume that the
alien has teeth exactly like yours, and is as smart as you, but it needs a clear step-by-step
instruction. List the steps. Be as detailed as you can. (Example: Hold the toothpaste with
your left hand; turn the cap anti-clockwise)
```
Pick up your toothpaste with your right hand
Twist the cap with your left hand counter-clockwise
Put the cap down on a surface
Pick up your toothbrush with your left hand
Put the tootpaste opening over the toothbrush's head where the brushes are
Squeeze the toothpase out so there's about just enough to cover half of the brush
Put the cap back on clockwise and put it down again
Pour a bit of water on the toothbrush
Start brushing your teeth
Do so in a motion that simulates a infinite sign, so in circles, gently
Do so on all the surfaces of your teeth evenly for about 3 minutes
Spit out the remains of the toothpaste in your mouth
Wash your toothbrush
Put it back down on surface
```

## Give your thoughts on BDD
### What was positive about using BDD
It gave structure to the process of making a method correctly

### What was annoying or difficult?
It was difficult to try and simulate the right value when comparing doubles, but I found out how to limit the amount it could fluctuate

### What surprised you?
How satisfying it was to get a green tick when a test passes

### Did BDD help you understand the problem domain more?
It was definitely a plus when trying to debug. So that when a thing fails, it's easier to understand where to try and fix that bug and isolate the problem.

### Did BDD help you write some tests you wouldn't otherwise have thought of?
I don't know if it helped me write tests that I wouldn't have thought of, but it definitely helped me structuring the methods I made and letting me see wether or not they worked as intended.
