##Reflections
###Shooting
A woman fired a shot at a man with her gun, but the man did not die. List the possible
reasons for the man not dying.
```
She missed
She hit a non vital organ
There was an ambulance nearby
It was a blank
```

###Alien
An alien meets you and it asks you to teach it how to brush its teeth. Assume that the
alien has teeth exactly like yours, and is as smart as you, but it needs a clear step-by-step
instruction. List the steps. Be as detailed as you can. (Example: Hold the toothpaste with
your left hand; turn the cap anti-clockwise)
```
Pick up your toothpaste with your right hand
Twist the cap with your left hand counter-clockwise
Put the cap down on a surface
Pick up your toothbrush with your left hand
Put the tootpaste opening over the toothbrush's head where the brushes are
Squeeze the toothpase out so there's about just enough to cover half of the brush
Put the cap back on clockwise and put it down again
Pour a bit of water on the toothbrush
Start brushing your teeth
Do so in a motion that simulates a infinite sign, so in circles, gently
Do so on all the surfaces of your teeth evenly for about 3 minutes
Spit out the remains of the toothpaste in your mouth
Wash your toothbrush
Put it back down on surface
```
